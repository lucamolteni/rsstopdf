# Future Ideas

* Use Quarkus Command Mode for easier native compilation via substitions (https://quarkus.io/guides/command-mode-reference)
* Use Quarkus PicloCLI https://quarkus.io/guides/picocli
* Create a Quarkus extension for rss-to-pdf
* Use JCTools `MessagePassingQueue` to store the threads execution https://jctools.github.io/JCTools/
* Fork the `papertex` template to handle articles with "magazine-like" images (i.e. very big on the left, very big on the right)
* Convert `papertex` to luatex

# TODO

* Create docker image to try it without having installed java and latex
* Upload an example to the website
* Fix the bug with unshowed images
